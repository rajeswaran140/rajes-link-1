        <h2>The journey I took to become a coder</h2>
        <p>
          Linkedin is a great place to start my coding journey. Youtube's
          hands-on interactive nature makes it engaging and easily accessible,
          with all course material available online. I hadn't been doing any
          programming or had anything to do with software as far as I could
          tell. My dream is to become a software developer by studying Coding. I
          remember trying to design a web many years ago. In my experience,
          WordPress is easy to create a website without coding skills, but it
          does not bring much knowledge because when I cannot write a single
          line of code, I cannot use WordPress themes to design the website.
          That is also another reason I intend to start to learn to code.
